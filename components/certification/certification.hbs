       Down Alternative Comforters
    </h2>

    <p class="tcs-copy-medium">
        For those that want an alternative to down or a more affordable fill, down alternative is a synthetic fill used in pillows, comforters, and mattress pads that mimics the loftiness and insulating qualities of down. To achieve the same warmth level of down, down alternative comforters may be a bit heavier than down comforters.
    </p>

    <h2 class="fs-14 fc-blue-2">
