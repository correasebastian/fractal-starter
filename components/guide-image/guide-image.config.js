                Did you know that comforters and duvet inserts are essentially the same thing? Both are typically filled with down, feathers, or synthetic fibers, will keep you warm, and can be used with our duvet covers which include an array of fun solid colors, fashionable prints, and premium fabrics. Duvet covers can also be interchanged frequently, are easily washed, and protect your investment so it’s a win-win.  
                All our comforters (and duvet inserts) have handy loops on all four corners that attach to our duvet cover ties to easily secure both in place.

                        Warm and comfortable, lightweight and breathable, down is Mother Nature’s most efficient insulator. Down comforters are long-lasting and resilient if given proper care which makes them a good investment for your bed.

                        No one sleeps the same, so choosing your warmth level comes down 
                        to personal preference. We offer multiple comforter warmth levels 
                        in down and down alternative options.  We even have a solution to the battle of the covers with our LaCrosse® Dual Comforter in both fill options—each side is crafted with different warmth levels so both partners can sleep in their preferred temperature.

                    What size comforter should you get? Obviously you want to consider the size of your bed, but also consider the look you prefer—do you want the comforter to just sit on the bed or do you want it to hang off the bed more like a bedspread? 
                    We have the four main sizes: Twin, Full, Queen, and King/California King. But did you know that we also have specialty sizes, such as Twin XL, Oversized Queen, and Oversized King.
