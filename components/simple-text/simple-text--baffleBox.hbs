        <p class="tcs-copy-medium">
            A well-made comforter is constructed to help ensure that warmth is evenly distributed. There are two main types of comforter construction in down comforters—baffle box and sewn-through box.  
            The one you select is a matter of personal preference.</br>
            In a baffle box construction, the stitching that creates the pockets for the down, is separated by internal fabric walls inside the comforter, creating a smooth look from the top.</br>
            In sewn-through box construction, the stitching that creates the pockets for the down, goes through the top and bottom layers of fabric, creating a puffy, pillow-like look from the top.

        <h3 class="fc-blue-2">How to Choose Your Comforter Shell Fabric  </h3>
        <p class="tcs-copy-medium">
            As with all our products, our comforter shells are crafted with premium fabrics—specifically cotton percale, cotton sateen, cotton cambric, and organic cotton. Any bedding product filled with down must have a special down-proof fabric which is tightly woven to keep the fill inside of its shell.
